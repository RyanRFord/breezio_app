# Ryan Ford's Breezio application
A quick demo of code and some tests.

deck.php defines the Deck class, with the functions that were asked for. 

deck_tests.php is a quick set of tests on the Deck class and its functions.

You can run deck_tests.php with no arguments as long as deck.php is in the same folder and php is installed.
